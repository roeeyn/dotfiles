# How to use

This is for setting up a new Macos Computer, based on the [Strap Project](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap).
For setting up your computer:
1. You need to save the files in the same folder structure as this project, and name the repo `dotfiles`.
2. Access the page of [Strap](https://strap.mikemcquaid.com/) and download the `strap.sh` file, which is customized with the GitHub Token.
3. Execute that file, and see the magic happens, you may add the `--debug` flag in case something goes wrong.
